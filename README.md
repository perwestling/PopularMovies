# API Key
To build, and deploy this, you need to add an API key. This file is ignored
by git to avoid it being checked in.
The API key xml file is in the following format:
--- BEGIN ---
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="api_key" translatable="false">apikey</string>
</resources>
--- END ---
To use this file place it as app/src/main/res/values/api_key.xml
and replace the value "apikey" above with your API key.
Note! Do NOT commit in this file.
